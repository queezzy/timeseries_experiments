# Timeseries Experiments

This repository consists on several notebook related to the handling and processing of timeseries.

The first notebook named timeseries_fundamentals aims to create artificial timeseries data and manipulate some key concepts such as:
* The trend
* The seasonality
* The noise

The second notebook named timeseries_basic_forecasting consists on basic methods used to predict the value of a specific serie given previous data. On that notebook we covered following approches : 

* The naive approach : It consists on predicting as the value of a timeserie x at time t, the value of that serie at time t-1. 
`x(t) = x(t-1)`
